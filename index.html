                                    The Statue of Liberty is one of the most famous symbols of freedom in the world. It
                                    is located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, USA. The statue was a gift from
                                    France to the United States in 1886, celebrating the friendship between the two
                                    nations and the American ideals of liberty and democracy.
                                    Designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the statue is made of copper
                                    and stands about 93 meters (305 feet) tall from the ground to the tip of the torch.
                                    The full name of the statue is "Liberty Enlightening the World."
                                    The Statue of Liberty holds a torch in her right hand, symbolizing enlightenment,
                                    and a tablet in her left hand, inscribed with the date of the American Declaration
                                    of Independence: July 4, 1776. At her feet are broken chains, representing the end
                                    of oppression.
                                    Today, the Statue of Liberty is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist
                                    attraction, welcoming millions of visitors each year. It continues to stand as a
                                    powerful symbol of hope, freedom, and opportunity for people around the world.</p>

                                <p>Rockefeller Center is a large complex of 19 commercial buildings located in the heart
                                    of Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was developed by the Rockefeller family
                                    during the Great Depression and officially opened in the 1930s. The center is named
                                    after John D. Rockefeller Jr., who financed its construction.
                                    One of the most famous landmarks in the complex is the GE Building, now known as the
                                    Comcast Building, which houses the headquarters of NBC. The observation deck, called
                                    Top of the Rock, offers breathtaking views of New York City.
                                    Rockefeller Center is also famous for its ice skating rink and giant Christmas tree
                                    that are displayed every winter, making it a popular holiday destination. In
                                    addition, the center features Radio City Music Hall, a historic entertainment venue
                                    known for the Rockettes dance troupe.
                                    Today, Rockefeller Center is a symbol of American resilience and innovation. It is
                                    not only a hub of media and business but also a major tourist attraction visited by
                                    millions every year.
